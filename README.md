## Notice
Goplex Live will not work with consoles that have been registered and attempted a connection with insignia, we do not have MACS Setup to provide the machine account yet, however we have a small open sourced tool available to testers to erase the insignia machine account. Upon reconnection to insignia, insignia MACS will grant a new Machine account for use on insignia.

# Goplex Live
Goplex Live is an Original Xbox Live revival project running on Xombie!
We are learning the way it works and we hope to improve xombie in order to get more services working inside Original Xbox Live!

# Getting your console ready for Goplex Live

It is best to have your IP configuration set to manual on an IP that you wont be using for anything else.

Our server runs a DNS server on **51.195.216.235** set that as your Primary DNS
Secondary DNS can be either the same or any other DNS you want to use.

Ensure everything is correct and hit connect,
If everything worked, you will be given the Xbox Live Not Found error about "MTU's" this means it worked but we don't have your console registered for a machine account.

# Registering your console

At the current time, we do not accept all users into the test, only people with emulators and games and are willing to help test it all out and even contribute to the coding.

However, to register the machine the info is on the testers panel on the discord server <https://dsc.owen2k6.com/>
